## Chapter 03 - Linear Regression: the basics
Linear regression is a method that summarizes how the average values of a numerical **outcome** variable vary over subpopulations defined by linear functions of **predictors**.

### 3.1. One predictor
- For a binary predictor, the regression coefficient is the difference between the averages of the two groups
- kid.score = 78 + 12 mom.hs + error : This model summarizes the difference in average test scores between the children of mothers who completed high school and those with mothers who did not.
